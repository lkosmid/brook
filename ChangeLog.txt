			    Brook GPU Release Notes

Release v0.4 (X/XX/04)

   * Added domain() operator with support under all runtimes

   * Runtime fixes:

      * Integrated GL/DX runtimes into single GPU runtime:

      * Both GL and DX run on nv3x r3xx nv4x and r4xx

      * Address translation is supported under GL/DX for nv3x nv4x
        Added indexof, iterator and domain support for address trans.

      * Fixed Variable Output bugs for 0-sized streams,
        Improved search performance

      * Gather addressing precision improved
      
      * gcc-3.4 compliant

   * Build environment fixes:

      * Added Visual Studio 7.1 build files

      * Regression test failures summarized at end of make regression

   * BRCC fixes:

      * Corrected Indexof precedence
 
      * Allow casts in variable declarations

      * Added code generation for fp40 ps2a ps2b ps3.0

Release v0.3 (1/29/04)

   * Support typedef structures for stream types.

   * Variable output streams supported.

   * Kernels can now have more than one output stream per kernel.  
   
   * Fixed major NVIDIA memory leak bug.  Also fixed pbuffer copyteximage
     slowdown.
   
   * Added warning messages when BRT_RUNTIME env not set.

   * Added much more type checking

   * Preliminary support for streams which are larger than dimensions
     of a texture

Release v0.2 (12/19/03)

   * nv30gl backend compiles and runs on Linux.  Requires Linux cgc compiler
     from NVIDIA and the latest drivers.

   * Fixed nv30gl reduce to stream bug.  nv30gl now passes all regression 
     tests

   * BRCC properly handles missing cgc and fxc.
     Produces reasonable error messages.

   * Make system includes Default.mk which only compiles cpu backend.
     Also tries to detect OS to choose the right configuration.  Builds 
     safely on Darwin (OS X).


Known Issues In BRCC

   * There is very little type checking on stream arguments-- especially in
     terms of length or dimensionality.  Passing a stream that's too small
     to streamRead() or streamWrite() can cause all sorts of misbehaviors.

   * Handling of floatN (float2, float3, float4) constructors is very
     fragile.  They're only legal in three places: variable declaration
     initializers, iterator stream constructors, and as bare statements.

   * The preprocessor is not run on .br files, though it is run on the
     resulting C++ output.  This can make it hard to use #defines and macros
     in conjunction with kernels or stream constructs.
   
   * GatherOps and ScatterOps require the CPU runtime and programs using
     them must compile for at least the CPU target.

   * In addition to the above problem with GatherOp/ScatterOp, any program
     that uses reductions will generate some boilerplate CPU code. This code
     will fail to compile unless the CPU compile target is enabled.
     
Known Issues in the Runtimes

   * In general, error conditions result in undefined behaviors and
     incorrect results, not necessarily crashes or reported errors.
   
   * OpenGL runtime performance is sub-optimal, because of issues with
     allocating and switching pbuffers. Of particular note:

        * Switching from one output stream type to another may degrade
          performance. For best results all output streams should be of
          a single type.

        * Switching the number of outputs being written may degrade
          performance on hardware that is capable of multiple outputs
          per pass.

     Once a stable spec and implementation of the frame_buffer_object
     OpenGL extension becomes available, some of these issues may be
     resolved.

   * The Linux OpenGL runtime is even slower and more constrained than
     the Windows OpenGL runtime.

        * Driver bugs keep us from reallocating pbuffers at runtime,
          so only a single pbuffer is allocated at application startup.

        * As a result, maximum stream size is limited to 2048x1024.

        * Attempting to run a multiple-output shader will fail.

        * All GPU kernels will be compiled with cgc. The cgc compiler
          may fail to generate code, or produce incorrect code for
          some shaders for which the Windows-only fxc compiler
          succeeds.

   * When writing to multiple outputs on a GPU runtime, incorrect results
     may be generated unless all outputs are of the same type.

   * The dx9 runtime cannot allocate streams that are longer than 2048 in
     any dimension.

   * The CPU runtime only supports a subset of the builtin Cg / HLSL
     functions.

   * The domain functionality is not fully orthogonal:

        * indexof values for stream domains are incorrect on the GPU

        * The domain operator cannot be applied to iterators

   * The reduction functionality is not fully orthogonal:
    
        * Reductions of domain() streams are not implemented

        * Reductions of streams of structure type are not implemented

        * Reductions of streams using address translation unimplemented

   * The constant argument functionality is not fully orthogonal

        * Constant arguments of structure type are unsupported

        * Constant arguments of array types are unsupported

   * Note that some Brook application errors may be the result of video
     card driver bugs.  Please refer to the GPGPU.org forums or the
     Brook project pages at (http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/brookgpu)
     for up to date information regarding any known driver issues.
