			    Brook GPU Release Notes

Known Issues In BRCC

   * There is very little type checking on stream arguments-- especially in
     terms of length or dimensionality.  Passing a stream that's too small
     to streamRead() or streamWrite() can cause all sorts of misbehaviors.

   * Handling of floatN (float2, float3, float4) constructors is very
     fragile.  They're only legal in three places: variable declaration
     initializers, iterator stream constructors, and as bare statements.

   * Casts are not correctly parsed in variable declaration initializers (as
     fallout of the above floatN constructors).

   * The preprocessor is not run on .br files, though it is run on the
     resulting C++ output.  This can make it hard to use #defines and macros
     in conjunction with kernels or stream constructs.
   
   * GatherOps and ScatterOps require the CPU runtime and so programs using
     them must compile for at least the CPU target.

   * The 'indexof' operator has very low precedence and is generally only
     useful with parentheses.
     
Known Issues in the Runtimes

   * In general, error conditions result in undefined behaviors and
     incorrect results, not necessarily crashes or reported errors.
   
   * The dx9 runtime cannot allocate streams that are longer than 2048 in
     any dimension or perform reductions on streams longer than 1024 in any
     dimension.

   * The cpu runtime only supports a subset of the builtin Cg / HLSL
     functions.
