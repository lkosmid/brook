Immediate
---------

   * Augment codegen so that it's fully able to run with the dx9 backend.

Short
-----

   * The lexer and parser should just passthrough preprocessor directives
     untouched.

   * Recognize gathers and emit stream gather calls.

   * Be able to fully compile a few useful sample programs (sort?).

   * Be able to compile code for multiple backends.

Medium
------

   * Incorporate reductions.  Find a sample program the uses reductions.

   * Be able to compile some beefier programs.

   * Other language extensions?

Long
----

   * Stream allocation

   * Multiple outputs

   * Optimizations within a given kernel

   * Optimizations across kernels (merging?)

   * Interpolant/constant streams
