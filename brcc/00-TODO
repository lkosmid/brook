Off the cuff
------------

   * Emit #line directives in the emitted cpp file.
   	- Hard unless done in every single statement.

   * Fix (boost) priority of 'indexof'

   * Command line / env override of paths to cgc / fxc?

Medium
------

   * Type verification for kernel calls (not passing float streams as float2
     streams, etc.)

   * Typedef support (e.g. "typedef float stream<10>").

   * Struct support (where all fields are floatN) to kernels.
   
Long
----

   * Refactor the grammar for expressions to create toplevel_expr (as all
     expressions except constructors) and then expr (to include
     constructors) rather than continually special casing them.

   * Allow kernels to call other kernels (as whole stream operations, not
     combinatorial explosion).

   * Stream allocation

   * Multiple outputs

   * Optimizations within a given kernel

   * Optimizations across kernels (merging?)

   * Interpolant/constant streams
