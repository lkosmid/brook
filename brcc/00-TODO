Immediate
---------

   * Augment codegen so that it's fully able to run with the dx9 backend.

Short
-----

   * Pull fp30_assist.bin out of v01.

   * The lexer and parser should just passthrough preprocessor directives
     untouched.

   * Recognize gathers and emit stream gather calls.

   * Be able to fully compile a few useful sample programs (sort?).

   * Be able to compile code for multiple backends.

Medium
------

   * Incorporate reductions.  Find a sample program the uses reductions.

   * Be able to compile some beefier programs.

   * Other language extensions?

   * Be able to switch between backends (fallback to cpp).

   * Type verification for kernel calls (not passing float streams as float2
     streams, etc.)

Long
----

   * Allow kernels to call other kernels (as whole stream operations, not
     combinatorial explosion).

   * Stream allocation

   * Multiple outputs

   * Optimizations within a given kernel

   * Optimizations across kernels (merging?)

   * Interpolant/constant streams
