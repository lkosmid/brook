Off the cuff
------------

   * Emit #line directives in the emitted cpp file.
   	- Hard unless done in every single statement.

   * Kernel to kernel calls?

   * Fix (boost) priority of 'indexof'

   * Command line / env override of paths to cgc / fxc?

Medium
------

   * Incorporate reductions.  Find a sample program the uses reductions.

   * Be able to compile some beefier programs.

   * Other language extensions?

   * Be able to switch between backends (fallback to cpp).

   * Type verification for kernel calls (not passing float streams as float2
     streams, etc.)
   
Long
----

   * Refactor the grammar for expressions to create toplevel_expr (as all
     expressions except constructors) and then expr (to include
     constructors) rather than continually special casing them.

   * Allow kernels to call other kernels (as whole stream operations, not
     combinatorial explosion).

   * Stream allocation

   * Multiple outputs

   * Optimizations within a given kernel

   * Optimizations across kernels (merging?)

   * Interpolant/constant streams
